## About Script Tracker
Welcome to script tracker! This application was built using Sinatra and ActiveRecord to help tv and film development teams, contest administrators and judges, and freelance script analysts like myself organize their coverage. Currently, Script Tracker can track the following for any entry:
- Title
- Date Read
- Recommendation
- Notes

## Running Script Tracker
To use Script Tracker, do the following:
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the directory (`script-coverage-app`)
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `shotgun`
- Enter the local url provided by `shotgun` (likely `localhost:9393`) into your browser
- Create an account and begin adding script coverage!
