## About Green Light
Welcome to Green Light! This application was built using Sinatra and ActiveRecord to help tv and film development teams, contest administrators and judges, and freelance script analysts like myself organize their coverage. Currently, Green Light can track the following for any entry:
- Title
- Date Read
- Recommendation
- Notes

## Running Green Light
To use Green Light, do the following:
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the directory (`script-coverage-app`)
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `shotgun`
- Enter the local address provided by `shotgun` (likely `localhost:9393`) into your browser
- Create an account and begin adding script coverage!
